# Tooltip Manual Test

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Use the **Tab** key to move focus to the "Home" button (labeled with `Back to role selection` tooltip).
3. Confirm that the tooltip appears when the button receives focus.
4. Press **Tab** again to move focus away. The tooltip should disappear.
5. Check that the tooltip appears next to the button and does **not** overlap the control itself.
6. Repeat steps 2â€“5 in both light and dark themes (e.g., using browser dev tools to simulate `prefers-color-scheme`).
