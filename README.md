# GPT WebApp with Local API Key Storage

This is a self-contained web application that:

âœ… Tracks staff metrics (outputs, outcomes, outtakes)  
âœ… Stores user data and API keys **locally** in the browser (`localStorage`)
âœ… Syncs entries to **Supabase** so progress is shared across devices
âœ… Lets admins enter API keys for **OpenAI, Gemini, CamoGPT, and AskSage**
âœ… Allows staff and PAO chiefs to **ask AI** using the selected provider
âœ… No backend required

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- PIN-based staff, PAO chief, and admin login
- Progress tracking (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- JSON import/export
- AI integration with real-time browser fetch
- Per-unit workspaces separating data by unit

## ðŸš€ Deployment
You can host this as a static page:
- **GitHub Pages**
- **Netlify**
- **Vercel**

### To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository
2. Push this project (`index.html`, etc.)
3. In GitHub settings, enable GitHub Pages on the `main` branch
4. Share the GitHub Pages link with your team

Enjoy!

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Automated check
Run `npm run test:tooltip` to confirm that tooltips respond to keyboard focus and blur events. The script runs against both light and dark color schemes.

### Manual check
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Use the **Tab** key to focus the "Home" button.
3. Verify the tooltip "Back to role selection" appears when focused.
4. Shift focus away and confirm the tooltip disappears.
5. Ensure the tooltip never overlaps the button that triggers it.
6. Repeat steps 2â€“5 in both light and dark themes.
